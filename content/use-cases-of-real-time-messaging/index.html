                    <p>
                        If asked for a use case for real-time messaging most people will answer: chat! Traditional
                        chat systems are a natural fit for RealMQ. It just needs a thin business layer on top of
                        RealMQ and some smart client side semantics. Luckily we provide some expressive recipes
                        and reference implementations.

                    <p>
                        Sometimes classic chat tools aren’t enough. You may want to dispatch support requests,
                        implement a multi stage flow with alternating chat partners, or build an interactive
                        chat menu to route the chat to the right department. With RealMQ you can implement all
                        of them - the limit is your imagination.

                        Today people are used to real time updates and immediate notifications on important

                        tablet when interacting with the digital world. Real-time events are the key.
